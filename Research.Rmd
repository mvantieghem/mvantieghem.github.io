#### Longitudinal changes in amygdala, hippocampus, and cortisol development following early caregiving adversity. 

Across a wide age-range (4-20), we show that the effects of early institutional caregiving on amygdala volume and cortisol change dynamically with age, while hippocampal effects are stable across development. 

We also show that amygdala and hippocampal volumes prospectively predict waking cortisol 2-3 years later, and are independently associated with internalizing symptoms across the entire sample.

#### Positive valence bias and parent-child relationship security moderate the association between early institutional caregiving and internalizing symptoms. 

We found that Previously Institutionalized youth showed a counter-intuitive positivity bias to surprised faces, relative to comparison youth. Positivity bias and greater parent-child security were both independently associated with lower internalizing symptoms following early institutional care, suggesting potential resilience factors at the individual and family level.
