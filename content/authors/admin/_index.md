I am a PhD candidate at Columbia University. My graduate research focused on understanding how early adversity influences neurobiology and stress physiology during childhood. In March 2020, I will begin a Postdoctoral position at NYU Langone Medical Center in the department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. I will be working in the SCAN Lab to investigate how the early environment influences prenatal and postnatal brain development.
