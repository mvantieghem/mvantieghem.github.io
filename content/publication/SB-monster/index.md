abstract: Decades of research have shown long-term effects of early caregiving adversity on stress-responsive neurobiology (e.g. stress physiology, amygdala, hippocampus). Although stress physiology and limbic brain regions undergo significant maturational change during childhood and adolescence, and reciprocally influence each other, the effects of early caregiving adversity on these developmental processes is not well understood. In the current study, we used an accelerated longitudinal design to assess the development of stress physiology, amygdala volume, and hippocampal volume following early institutional care. Previously Institutionalized (PI) and comparison youth (N = 254, ages 4-20 years old) completed 1-3 waves of data collection, each spaced 2 years apart, for diurnal cortisol (N = 240, 381 diurnal datasets), structural MRI (N = 157, 307 scans) and parent-reported internalizing symptoms (N = 133, 227 time points). We observed a developmental shift in waking cortisol in the PI group, with blunted levels in childhood and heightened levels in late adolescence. PI history was associated with reduced hippocampal volume and reduced growth of the amygdala, resulting in smaller volumes by adolescence. Results also suggested feed-forward brain-to-hormone mechanisms, such that both amygdala and hippocampal volumes were prospectively associated with waking cortisol levels two years later. Finally, amygdala and hippocampal volumes were independently associated with internalizing scores across the entire sample. These results indicate that adversity-related phenotypes are not stationary during development but instead exhibit dynamic and interdependent changes from early childhood to early adulthood.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In an accelerated longitudinal design, we show that development of stress physiology and limbic brain volume is dynamic following early caregiving adversity. Specifically, we show that effects of early caregiving adversity on cortisol and amygdala volume change with age, whereas hippocampal volume reductions are consistent from childhood to adolescence. Limbic brain volume was also associated with future waking cortisol and concurrent internalizing symptoms.
