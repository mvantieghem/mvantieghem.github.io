## About me 
I am a PhD Candidate at Columbia University, working in the [Developmental Affective Neuroscience Lab](https://danlab7.wixsite.com/mysite/). My graduate research has focused on neurobiological and behavioral development following early adversity. My projects have used structural and functional neuroimaging, behavioral tasks and physiological measures (e.g. cortisol). This research has been funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Science Foundation, and the American Psychological Foundation. 

In February 2020, I will begin a post-doctoral fellowship at NYU Child & Adolscent Psychiatry Department, working with Moriah Thomason in the SCAN lab.

Outside the lab, I can be found riding my bike with the [NYCC Women's Race Team](nyccwomensracing.com)
