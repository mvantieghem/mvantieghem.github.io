You're an R user who is looking to make a professional webpage that:\n Takes advantage of Hugo website themes  Doesn't require learning html or java Can be hosted on a free domain (Github Pages)   Note: This tutorial assumes that you have basic proficiency using Github, R studio, and github repositories with R projects. If you aren't comfortable with this yet, start here instead.\n*Disclaimer: This is meant to be a quick step-by-step guide to generate a webpage from beginning to end. For more a more extensive guide on all things related to using blogdown, see the official Blogdown documentation .\nPart 1: Build your website 1.1 Choose a theme for your website  Hugo has a wide array of website themes, which can be found here.  Themes dictate both the aethetics and the format of a website. Choose wisely. Once you start with a certain theme, it's hard to switch themes later.  1.2 Use blogdown to generate a website template   Once you've chosen a theme, click \u0026ldquo;Homepage\u0026rdquo; on the theme website, which leads you to the owner's github repository for the theme. We will use this github project (e.g. \u0026ldquo;user/themename\u0026rdquo;) as input to the blogdown::new_website function. Step by step instructions below:\n  in R studio, install the blogdown package and load the library.\ninstall.packages(\u0026lsquo;blogdown\u0026rsquo;) install.packages(\u0026lsquo;hugo\u0026rsquo;) library(blogdown)\n  Make a brand new R project in a new directory\nFile \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New Project \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New directory \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; choose location\n  Generate a website from the theme template in your R Project.\nblogdown::new_website(theme = \u0026ldquo;user/themename\u0026rdquo;)\n  1.3 Edit content on your website Every theme has a slightly different setup, but we will walk through the basic overview. You can also read the theme documentation for more details on your chosen theme.\n Config and menu files contain the backbone structure of your website. Config files designate the url, theme, and title of your website. Menu files designate the \u0026ldquo;widgets\u0026rdquo; or components of your website (which varies by theme). Disclaimer: depending on the theme, these files may be in the main directory or different locations (e.g. in the \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;config\u0026rdquo; folders) and might end with either \u0026ldquo;.toml\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;.yml\u0026rdquo;. Content: This is where most of your editing will take place. The organization of this folder will vary depending on your chosen theme, and the files here should coincide with your menu. Static: This is the storage location for any static files that you add to your website. For example, you can add PDF files or images that you link in the content. Themes: This stores the necessary code to build the website using your chosen theme. Do not edit! Public: Contains the live website, built from the contents and configurations. Do not edit!  It will take some trial-and-error to figure out how changes in these files correspond to changes in the website. Try making a simple change first, like changing the title of your webpage in the config file, annd see how it changes your webpage. The next step describes how to preview your site.\n1.4 Preview your website as you make changes  You can see changes live as you save them by rendering the site\nblogdown::serve_site() The webpage will automatically display in the viewer panel of R studio. To see the webpage preview in full size, click open in a new window (on the top left of the Viewer panel) to open it in your browser.  Do I need to run serve_site() after every change I make?\nIt depends. After running it once, the webpage preview will automatically refresh after each time you save changes to existing files, but if you remove or add new widgets, you will need to re-run the command to view those structural changes.\nPart 2: Link the website to github Before we start, it's important to explain that there will be 2 separate github repositories for this website. This is because hugo (and many website platforms) separate editable content from your live website content (\u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder).\n1. webpage: This repository will contain the editable contents of your website, which you already generated in step 1.\n2. username.github.io: This repository will be a submodule of the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; repository. It contains the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder of your website, and is used to generate your live website on github pages.\n2.1 Make a \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; repository  make a new repository on github, and call it \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; or whatever you'd like to call your main website repo. Don't add anything to the repository yet! Copy the \u0026lsquo;clone\u0026rsquo; link for your new repository. Open R studio and click File \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New Project. Choose \u0026lsquo;from version control\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Github\u0026rsquo; in the project options. Create your R project using the copied repository link. Then copy the entire contents of your Hugo website into the new R project directory \u0026amp; close your R project.  2.2 Make the \u0026lsquo;username.github.io\u0026rsquo; repository and add it as a submodule.  Make a new repository on github called username.github.io. Github pages will automatically generate a webpage from any repository with this specific name, so unfortunately you cannot be creative here! Open terminal and navigate to your webpage directory on your local machine:\ncd /your-local-directories/webpage/ Delete your public repository: rm -rf public Now we are going to add our \u0026lsquo;username.github.io\u0026rsquo; repository as a submodule of the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; repository: submodule add -b master https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git public Next time we serve the site, the \u0026lsquo;username.github.io.git\u0026rsquo; repository will contain the contents of the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; directory.  2.3 Set your website html address  Open the config.toml file in the home directory of your webpage_hugo R project. Replace the baseURL https://example.com with your github page domain: https://username.github.io Save the changes to the config.toml file.  For additional information and trouble-shooting, see the related Hugo documentation for hosting websites on github pages.\nPart 3: Serve website 3.1 Edit content on your webpage  Open your \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; R project to continue editing content on your website. Re-generate the public folder with updated content: blogdown::serve_site()  3.2 Deploy your changes to the live website  Here, we are going to push the changes to the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; directory to our \u0026lsquo;username.github.io\u0026rsquo; repository. This step has to be done in terminal, not R studio. In terminal, navigate to the public folder of the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; directory.\ncd webpage/public Add, commit and push your changes with the following lines of code:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \u0026ldquo;my message here\u0026rdquo;\ngit push origin master Check your live website updates at username.github.io  3.3 Track your content changes to the website repository  Here, we are going to push the changes of the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; directory to the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; repository. I prefer to do this using R studio. Exclude the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder from being tracked by adding this line to your .gitignore file: public/. Make sure you commit \u0026amp; push the updated .gitignore file too.  You now have a functioning website built with github, R and hugo!\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"0095eaee4eb5f4e668791ee0e3c86f4d","permalink":"/tutorials/website_tutorial/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutorials/website_tutorial/","section":"tutorials","summary":"Learn how to create a website using the Blogdown package in R, with Hugo and github pages.","tags":null,"title":"Make a website using R and Github pages","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Have you ever wondered\u0026hellip;\n What are R projects, and why do I need to use them?

First, you want to make a new github repository, and link it to a new R project.\nNot familiar with linking github and R? When making a new new R project, choose the option \u0026lsquo;from version control\u0026rsquo;, then \u0026lsquo;Github\u0026rsquo;. On the next page, add the link to your git repository.\nThe \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder should not be added to this repository! An easy way to deal with this is to add the public directory to your .gitignore file.\nWhen you're happy with the content of your webpage, add, commit and push the website content to the ‘webpage’ repository.\nMake a \u0026lsquo;github pages\u0026rsquo; repository\nHugo, like many other website platforms, separates the editable content of your website from the live website content, also commonly referred to as the \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; content.

Therefore, determining how caregivers regulate children's affective neurobiology is essential for understanding psychopathology etiology and prevention. Much of the research on affective functioning uses fear learning to map maturation trajectories, with both rodent and human studies contributing knowledge. Nonetheless, as no standard framework exists through which to interpret developmental effects across species, research often remains siloed, thus contributing to the current therapeutic impasse. Here, we propose a developmental ecology framework that attempts to understand fear in the ecological context of the child; their relationship with their parent. By referring to developmental goals that are shared across species (to attach to, then, ultimately, separate from the parent), this framework provides a common grounding from which fear systems and their dysfunction can be understood, thus advancing research on psychopathologies and their treatment.","tags":null,"title":"Using a Developmental Ecology Framework to Align Fear Neurobiology Across Species","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation  Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export : E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let's make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

These longitudinal studies involve research visits at multiple time points, presenting challenges for project management across long timescales. The optimal study design to answer a given research question must be balanced with logistical constraints of the research team, and the time burden placed on participating families.\nMany variables are considered when designing a longitudinal study:\n total number of participants (50, or 500?) total duration of the study (e.g. 6 months or 6 years?) target age of participants at each visit (newborn, 12 months, 5 years?) target populations of interest (e.g. low vs. high SES?)  I developed an interactive tool to facilitate study planning for longitudinal research studies. It's specifically geared towards research groups with existing pregnancy cohorts that plan to conduct infant follow-up assessments (e.g. newborn, 6-month and 12-month). Given how rapidly infants reach developmental milestones, the timing of study assessments is extremely important.\nThe web application, developed with R shiny, allows the researcher to provide their own source data for their unique study cohort, and see how study decisions impact the long-term study forecast. The source data includes birth dates (or due dates), and any enrichment variables relevant to that cohort (e.g. income brackets). The user can then interactively change the total number of participants to be included, time intervals between visits, target age of participants at each visit, and the total duration of the study. The output provides summary metrics, with figures to vizualize the projected volume of study visits over time. Once the study design has been selected, the output tables can then be used by project managers to effectively plan study operations and study budgets on a weekly basis.\nThis work was done during my Post-doctoral fellowship at NYU Langone Health.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"845ec22e077deaad63e161d2697ec8ca","permalink":"/project/study-forecast/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/study-forecast/","section":"project","summary":"An interactive web application to facilitate study planning \u0026 project management for longitudinal research.","tags":null,"title":"Forecasting tool for longitudinal studies","type":"project"}]
