You're an R user who is looking to make a professional webpage that:\n Takes advantage of Hugo website themes  Doesn't require learning html or java Can be hosted on a free domain (Github Pages)   Note: This tutorial assumes that you have basic proficiency using Github, R studio, and github repositories with R projects. If you aren't comfortable with this yet, start here instead.\n*Disclaimer: This is meant to be a quick step-by-step guide to generate a webpage from beginning to end. For more a more extensive guide on all things related to using blogdown, see the official Blogdown documentation .\nPart 1: Build your website 1.1 Choose a theme for your website  Hugo has a wide array of website themes, which can be found here.  Themes dictate both the aethetics and the format of a website. Choose wisely. Once you start with a certain theme, it's hard to switch themes later.  1.2 Use blogdown to generate a website template   Once you've chosen a theme, click \u0026ldquo;Homepage\u0026rdquo; on the theme website, which leads you to the owner's github repository for the theme. We will use this github project (e.g. \u0026ldquo;user/themename\u0026rdquo;) as input to the blogdown::new_website function. Step by step instructions below:\n  in R studio, install the blogdown package and load the library.\ninstall.packages(\u0026lsquo;blogdown\u0026rsquo;) install.packages(\u0026lsquo;hugo\u0026rsquo;) library(blogdown)\n  Make a brand new R project in a new directory\nFile \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New Project \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New directory \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; choose location\n  Generate a website from the theme template in your R Project.\nblogdown::new_website(theme = \u0026ldquo;user/themename\u0026rdquo;)\n  1.3 Edit content on your website Every theme has a slightly different setup, but we will walk through the basic overview. You can also read the theme documentation for more details on your chosen theme.\n Config and menu files contain the backbone structure of your website. Config files designate the url, theme, and title of your website. Menu files designate the \u0026ldquo;widgets\u0026rdquo; or components of your website (which varies by theme). Disclaimer: depending on the theme, these files may be in the main directory or different locations (e.g. in the \u0026ldquo;data\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;config\u0026rdquo; folders) and might end with either \u0026ldquo;.toml\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;.yml\u0026rdquo;. Content: This is where most of your editing will take place. The organization of this folder will vary depending on your chosen theme, and the files here should coincide with your menu. Static: This is the storage location for any static files that you add to your website. For example, you can add PDF files or images that you link in the content. Themes: This stores the necessary code to build the website using your chosen theme. Do not edit! Public: Contains the live website, built from the contents and configurations. Do not edit!  It will take some trial-and-error to figure out how changes in these files correspond to changes in the website. Try making a simple change first, like changing the title of your webpage in the config file, annd see how it changes your webpage. The next step describes how to preview your site.\n1.4 Preview your website as you make changes  You can see changes live as you save them by rendering the site\nblogdown::serve_site() The webpage will automatically display in the viewer panel of R studio. To see the webpage preview in full size, click open in a new window (on the top left of the Viewer panel) to open it in your browser.  Do I need to run serve_site() after every change I make?\nIt depends. After running it once, the webpage preview will automatically refresh after each time you save changes to existing files, but if you remove or add new widgets, you will need to re-run the command to view those structural changes.\nPart 2: Link the website to github Before we start, it's important to explain that there will be 2 separate github repositories for this website. This is because hugo (and many website platforms) separate editable content from your live website content (\u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder).\n1. webpage: This repository will contain the editable contents of your website, which you already generated in step 1.\n2. username.github.io: This repository will be a submodule of the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; repository. It contains the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder of your website, and is used to generate your live website on github pages.\n2.1 Make a \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; repository  make a new repository on github, and call it \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; or whatever you'd like to call your main website repo. Don't add anything to the repository yet! Copy the \u0026lsquo;clone\u0026rsquo; link for your new repository. Open R studio and click File \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; New Project. Choose \u0026lsquo;from version control\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Github\u0026rsquo; in the project options. Create your R project using the copied repository link. Then copy the entire contents of your Hugo website into the new R project directory \u0026amp; close your R project.  2.2 Make the \u0026lsquo;username.github.io\u0026rsquo; repository and add it as a submodule.  Make a new repository on github called username.github.io. Github pages will automatically generate a webpage from any repository with this specific name, so unfortunately you cannot be creative here! Open terminal and navigate to your webpage directory on your local machine:\ncd /your-local-directories/webpage/ Delete your public repository: rm -rf public Now we are going to add our \u0026lsquo;username.github.io\u0026rsquo; repository as a submodule of the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; repository: submodule add -b master https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git public Next time we serve the site, the \u0026lsquo;username.github.io.git\u0026rsquo; repository will contain the contents of the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; directory.  2.3 Set your website html address  Open the config.toml file in the home directory of your webpage_hugo R project. Replace the baseURL https://example.com with your github page domain: https://username.github.io Save the changes to the config.toml file.  For additional information and trouble-shooting, see the related Hugo documentation for hosting websites on github pages.\nPart 3: Serve website 3.1 Edit content on your webpage  Open your \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; R project to continue editing content on your website. Re-generate the public folder with updated content: blogdown::serve_site()  3.2 Deploy your changes to the live website  Here, we are going to push the changes to the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; directory to our \u0026lsquo;username.github.io\u0026rsquo; repository. This step has to be done in terminal, not R studio. In terminal, navigate to the public folder of the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; directory.\ncd webpage/public Add, commit and push your changes with the following lines of code:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \u0026ldquo;my message here\u0026rdquo;\ngit push origin master Check your live website updates at username.github.io  3.3 Track your content changes to the website repository  Here, we are going to push the changes of the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; directory to the \u0026lsquo;webpage\u0026rsquo; repository. I prefer to do this using R studio. Exclude the \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder from being tracked by adding this line to your .gitignore file: public/. Make sure you commit \u0026amp; push the updated .gitignore file too.  You now have a functioning website built with github, R and hugo!\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"499ad4ba4b63d03efafe79e544f05d5e","permalink":"/drafts/tutorials/website_tutorial/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/drafts/tutorials/website_tutorial/","section":"drafts","summary":"Learn how to create a website using the Blogdown package in R, with Hugo and github pages.","tags":null,"title":"Make a website using R and Github pages","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Have you ever wondered\u0026hellip;\n What are R projects, and why do I need to use them?

First, you want to make a new github repository, and link it to a new R project.\nNot familiar with linking github and R? When making a new new R project, choose the option \u0026lsquo;from version control\u0026rsquo;, then \u0026lsquo;Github\u0026rsquo;. On the next page, add the link to your git repository.\nThe \u0026lsquo;public\u0026rsquo; folder should not be added to this repository! An easy way to deal with this is to add the public directory to your .gitignore file.\nWhen you're happy with the content of your webpage, add, commit and push the website content to the ‘webpage’ repository.\nMake a \u0026lsquo;github pages\u0026rsquo; repository\nHugo, like many other website platforms, separates the editable content of your website from the live website content, also commonly referred to as the \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; content.

I’ll save those stories for another time. But through all of these experiences, I learned about the common misconceptions about head injury, helmets, and concussion severity.\n1. You didn’t lose consciousness! When describing my crash, the first question everyone asked me was the same: did you lose consciousness? This common assumption – that head injuries are only serious if you lose consciousness – is largely false. Loss of consciousness only occurs in about 10% of head injuries, and research is inconclusive about whether loss of consciousness actually predicts concussion severity or recovery time. In reality, there are several other risk factors that are more important, and often over-looked. For example, even though men are twice as likely to have a head injury, women are much more likely to suffer from concussions. Likewise, prior history of head injury, and prior mental health history also influence how quickly an individual might recover from a head injury.\n2. Your helmet didn’t break! One common misconception, which is prevalent both in the cycling community and the emergency room, is that a head injury doesn’t need to be taken seriously if you were wearing your helmet, especially if the helmet didn’t break. But the reality is that industry standards only require that a cycling helmet protects against serious traumatic brain injury, like a skull fracture. Your helmet will likely save your life, but it won’t prevent a concussion. Only recently have new helmet technologies been developed to protect against concussions, by trying to minimize the rotational forces that occur when your head makes impact. However, these helmets are very new, and proprietary, with very little objective research (i.e. not funded by the company) that have tested their efficacy in the real world.\n3. Your CT scan was negative! The most common test performed following a head injury is a CT scan, which is used to diagnose acute problems like intracranial bleeding that require urgent medical attention. If your doctor says the CT scan is clear, that means your helmet did its job – it prevented a life-threatening situation. However, you may still have a concussion. There are no biological or imaging tests that can diagnose a concussion. The symptoms are largely invisible, and can only be diagnosed from the patient’s own self-report (e.g. feeling foggy, irritable, dizzy, or having difficulty concentrating). Importantly, these symptoms may not emerge until hours or days after you’ve left the emergency room. That’s why follow-up evaluations are recommended for anyone who sustains a head injury - even if you are feeling fine in the initial few days afterward.\nConcussion Resources:   Concussion signs and symptoms from the CDC    Concussion Do's and Don'ts\n  Concussion management from USA Cycling   Medicine of Cycling Traumatic Brain Injury Flow Chart   ","date":1576713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576713600,"objectID":"13f14b2a54957e5a4c560fcde40c3000","permalink":"/cycling_blog/concussion2/","publishdate":"2019-12-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cycling_blog/concussion2/","section":"cycling_blog","summary":"Since that first accident 18 months ago, I’ve had two more crashes, and unfortunately, two more concussions.

Therefore, determining how caregivers regulate children's affective neurobiology is essential for understanding psychopathology etiology and prevention. Much of the research on affective functioning uses fear learning to map maturation trajectories, with both rodent and human studies contributing knowledge. Nonetheless, as no standard framework exists through which to interpret developmental effects across species, research often remains siloed, thus contributing to the current therapeutic impasse. Here, we propose a developmental ecology framework that attempts to understand fear in the ecological context of the child; their relationship with their parent. By referring to developmental goals that are shared across species (to attach to, then, ultimately, separate from the parent), this framework provides a common grounding from which fear systems and their dysfunction can be understood, thus advancing research on psychopathologies and their treatment.","tags":null,"title":"Using a Developmental Ecology Framework to Align Fear Neurobiology Across Species","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic  Academic | Documentation  Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click  PDF Export : E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let's make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

These longitudinal studies involve research visits at multiple time points, presenting challenges for project management across long timescales. The optimal study design to answer a given research question must be balanced with logistical constraints of the research team, and the time burden placed on participating families.\nMany variables are considered when designing a longitudinal study:\n total number of participants (50, or 500?) total duration of the study (e.g. 6 months or 6 years?) target age of participants at each visit (newborn, 12 months, 5 years?) target populations of interest (e.g. low vs. high SES?)  I developed an interactive tool to facilitate study planning for longitudinal research studies. It's specifically geared towards research groups with existing pregnancy cohorts that plan to conduct infant follow-up assessments (e.g. newborn, 6-month and 12-month). Given how rapidly infants reach developmental milestones, the timing of study assessments is extremely important.\nThe web application, developed with R shiny, allows the researcher to provide their own source data for their unique study cohort, and see how study decisions impact the long-term study forecast. The source data includes birth dates (or due dates), and any enrichment variables relevant to that cohort (e.g. income brackets). The user can then interactively change the total number of participants to be included, time intervals between visits, target age of participants at each visit, and the total duration of the study. The output provides summary metrics, with figures to vizualize the projected volume of study visits over time. Once the study design has been selected, the output tables can then be used by project managers to effectively plan study operations and study budgets on a weekly basis.\nThis work was done during my Post-doctoral fellowship at NYU Langone Health.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"845ec22e077deaad63e161d2697ec8ca","permalink":"/project/study-forecast/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/study-forecast/","section":"project","summary":"An interactive web application to facilitate study planning \u0026 project management for longitudinal research.","tags":null,"title":"Forecasting tool for longitudinal studies","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This post is the first of a series of posts on concussions and recovery.\nIt was my first full season of racing, and after a couple of near-misses on the Cat 4/5 podium, it was my last chance to show off my new-found love for racing criteriums. Bored of Central Park by this late in the season, I opted to go north on the west side bike path to the less traveled Fort Tryon Park in Inwood. I did a short workout, easy openers to prep my legs for the next day’s race: Fort Lee Crit. The riding conditions were great - it had rained overnight, but the sun was out and it was such a nice day that it was hard to resist the urge to join my friends for a long ride across the GW bridge. But with my goal set on having fresh legs for the next day, I started to make my way home, thinking that I was safer on the bike path than on the roads in Washington Heights.\nIf you ever ride north of 155th St, you’ll know the bridge: the broken, run-down, wooden bridge that used to be adorned with gaping holes and giant orange cones, which crosses over the abandoned train tracks. Having ridden across a dozen times by now, I didn’t think twice as I coasted down the hill southbound, and rode onto the bridge at around 10 mph. As I carefully avoided the gaping wooden holes and orange cones, my front tire wedged between 2 planks of wet, rotten, slippery wood. I lost control of my bike, and fell toward my left side, with the side of my head being the first point of contact. Dazed, but having not lost consciousness, I lied there stunned in the middle of the bridge. A few runners who had witnessed the incident stopped to ask me if I was ok. I wasn’t sure. I was talking normally and could even get up to walk my bike to the side of the path, but they still wanted to call 911. In the 30 minutes that we waited for the ambulance, two more cyclists wiped out at the same spot on the bridge.\nWhen I was finally at the ER, the physician’s assistant who evaluated me was not concerned about my head injury. My helmet didn’t crack. I didn’t lose consciousness. My pupils weren’t dilated, and I wasn’t vomiting, nauseous, or dizzy. I told her I had a big race the next day, and I was anxious to hear the answer: could I race? Would it be safe? She merely advised me to see how I felt. As a determined athlete, her nonchalance seemed like a green light that I was good to go. She handed me a pamphlet on how to treat road rash, and I was discharged.\nThe most important thing that this doctor did not tell me is that concussion symptoms might not appear right away. In fact, they may not appear for hours or days, but could persist for weeks or months.\nAfter taking it easy the rest of the day, I woke up the next morning feeling great and ready to race. I practiced the course so much, I knew it by heart - especially the punchy hill that dropped half the field on the first lap. In the end, I got 4th place, again, but I didn’t care - I was thrilled that my crash hadn’t held me back. I was so elated on my post-race high that I did a social ride up River Road with my friends afterwards, and even PRed on Alpine! But after lunch, I was so tired that I could hardly make my way back down 9W. My boyfriend, who loves to chase after random wheels, had left me in the dust. I looked at the low numbers on my power meter and thought, damn I am tired. But that was normal after a bike race, right?\nDuring the next few days, things were as normal as they could be. Except, when I sat at my computer, I couldn’t keep my head up or my eyes open. With my stubborn PhD student work ethic, I tried to drag myself through the rest of the week, buying extra afternoon coffees, eager to get to the weekend stage race I had planned. Other than some mild neck whiplash and fatigue, I seemed fine. But by the weekend, I started getting head fog and dizziness on the bike. I decided I shouldn’t race, so I cheered my teammates from the sidelines. When I returned to the city on Monday, more than a week after my crash, it got worse. Daily activities, like riding the subway or working on the computer, would trigger a headache.\nMy primary care doctor told me to take time off from school and recommended I see a concussion specialist. Thanks to the over-burdened healthcare system in NYC, the next available appointment wasn’t for 4 weeks. I spent the next month trying to manage my symptoms on my own. Not wanting to relent on my summer plans, I attempted a beach vacation, a bachelorette party, and an international conference, all while trying to avoid my headache triggers: computer screens, direct sunlight, loud noise, heat, and alcohol. The subway was a nightmare, florescent lights were terrible, and bars were even worse. I would sleep 10+ hours a night, and took naps whenever I could. I wouldn’t go anywhere without Excedrin, crime podcasts, and my noise-cancelling headphones.\nBy the time I had my specialist appointment a month later, my day-to-day symptoms had started to improve, but the evaluation revealed more symptoms that I had hardly noticed amid the blinding headaches. Neuropsychology testing showed small deficits in my working memory and balance. I learned that my dizziness on the bike was from the damage to my inner ear from the crash. I started vestibular physical therapy, where I did balance exercises, and occupational therapy, where they gave me strategies to get through my work at the computer.\nThere is no one-size fits-all prognosis for how bad your symptoms will be after a concussion, or how quickly you’ll get better. While friends of mine have recovered from their bike-related head injuries in a few days, it took me almost 3 months to fully recover. I stayed on the indoor trainer for weeks until I was finally ready to bike outside again. Eventually, and very slowly, I got better, and I learned a lot about concussions in the process. The goal of this blog series is to help educate other cyclists about concussions, and the common misconceptions surrounding them.\nConcussion Resources:\n  Concussion signs and symptoms from the CDC    Concussion Do's and Don'ts\n  Concussion management USA Cycling   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"44b05dff3abe2410f8d15d87c36386be","permalink":"/cycling_blog/concussion1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cycling_blog/concussion1/","section":"cycling_blog","summary":"This post is the first of a series of posts on concussions and recovery.\nIt was my first full season of racing, and after a couple of near-misses on the Cat 4/5 podium, it was my last chance to show off my new-found love for racing criteriums.
