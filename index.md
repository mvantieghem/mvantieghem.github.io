<h2 id="oneoffs">Additional instructional materials</h2>

Many of these materials were originally prepared as presentations for Columbia Psychology R users,
but are also designed to be stand-alone tutorials that you can read through and learn from remotely.
These materials span a wider range of learner skill levels, and assume basic experience with
scientific computing.
